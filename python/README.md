## Python in Data Migration

Python is used here to support data migration by handling tasks that go beyond pure SQL â€” such as automating ETL workflows, validating data across environments, transforming unstructured inputs (e.g. JSON, CSV), and integrating with APIs or file systems. It enables reproducible, testable pipelines and bridges gaps where SQL Server alone isn't sufficient.
