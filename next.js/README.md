##  Next.js in Data Migration

Next.js is used to build internal tools and dashboards that support the data migration process. It provides a modern frontend for visualising data quality, monitoring progress, managing configurations, and triggering migration steps via API. This enables technical and non-technical users to interact with the migration pipeline in a clear, user-friendly way.
